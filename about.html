                    <p class="about-text"> Hey there - I’m Tiffany, otherwise known as Enchanted Bird. By day, I masquerade as a business bird at
                        an office job, sitting in my window cubicle and doing my part to help make the world a better place.
                        By night, I get to be the free bird that I truly am at home with my husband and fur baby, who are
                        both much, much cooler than I am. </p>

                    <p class="about-text"> For those who feel like they’ll know me better by my “stats” – I am a sun sign Cancer, moon sign Libra
                        (with a Moon Pluto conjunction), Leo rising, with a Taurus midheaven. </p>

                </div>

                <p class="about-text"> My interest in the esoteric and paranormal is deeply-rooted; my ancestry includes multiple generations of
                    witches, as well as a clairvoyant who was often called upon as a healer through “laying of hands.” Growing
                    up deep in the mountains of Appalachia, the paranormal was simply the normal and many of the folk traditions
                    that were common in my family were simply thinly-veiled rituals and spells. It wasn’t until much later
                    in life that I had the knowledge and proper context to place them in.</p>


                <p class="about-text"> These days I am trying to focus on being my best self – establishing an exercise routine that I will stick
                    with, eating as healthy as possible, using meditation to improve my mental health, and knowing how and
                    when to ask the universe for assistance with my goals. </p>

                <p class="about-text"> I’ll never claim to have all the answers, but I have accumulated a lot of wisdom and experience and I’m happy
                    to share it with friends. Whether I’m contemplating life in general, freaking out about work, musing
                    over a particular spell or seeking guidance from the tarot, I’ll be here sharing it all. I’m so glad
                    you’ve joined me. </p>
